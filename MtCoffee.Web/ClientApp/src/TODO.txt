Fix bug:
1. Add items to order page.
2. Make item picker visible.
3. Resize (reduce width)
4. Make item picker invisible.
Sometimes this will glitch the picker. We have to do a hack to fix it rn. But we should do it proper.

Feature: When navigating away from orders page, SAVE the order so content is not lost.


TODO: Fix number picker AMOUNT entry where the first key goes to the 10ths place.
0.90 should be 0.09 at first key press.
